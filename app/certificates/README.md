Certificates
============

Here's the place for the signing certificate. Add it to this folder and call
it 'certificate.p12'. It is ignored by the .gitignore file (you really do NOT
want to check in your certificate publically), but it is used by the Rakefiles
to sign both the extension and the AIR test application.
